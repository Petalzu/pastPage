## Brief introduction

Based on the software development of neatbeans, I built the personal website.

## My construction idea:

1. Create a home page and list access sub pages.

2. Introduce yourself and your experience in different pages.

3. There are about me, photo album and blog.

<！>4. The blog is still under development.

## Open source technology adopted:

1. Special effects open source code materials are learned from < a target = "_blank" href=“ https://card.niconi.co.ni "> ll card Checker (specifically shown in the home page special effects).

2. Shutters and layered pseudo effects are the results of my personal learning.

3. Blog technology is beyond my ability, so it is temporarily shelved.

## My thoughts:

1. Mainly use CSS and JS to determine the effect of buttons and avatars. Use the function to achieve the pseudo dynamic blur effect of the home page. The idea of this function is to change the layer by determining the mouse position.

2. The layer overlay function is used to show the Pseudo 3D effect (JS and CSS are not single column files because there are few contents in this part). The idea of this function is to shift the layer through the roller.

3. Based on CSS, the function of adapting media devices of different sizes is edited for the home page. Unfortunately, the same technique did not work in the album.

## Summary:

My goal is to create and build a real personal website. I still feel unable to start when facing problems. For example, I am currently facing the problem that adding different effects to the page will affect other content. I hope to launch my personal website one day.

In addition, I added a lot of subculture content loved by young people when designing the album.

## Update 2023/2/14

The blog construction has been completed and improved in many aspects.The next step is to improve the video page, photo page and about me page.In addition, my personal articles should be placed on the blog.

I plan to add statistical browsing data and comments, but I still don't know how to do that. First of all, take learning as the goal.

Special thanks to my teacher Prof.Castor.(I used some of his code, and I am still waiting for his reply. If there is any change, I will update it in time.)


## Update 2023/3/17

Added a calendar feature based on fullcalendar. The website construction has been preliminarily improved, and no major updates are expected. 

The next step is to migrate the website to a personal server and use a separate domain name.
